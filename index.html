            <h1>Good day!</h1>
            <p class="intro">
                Welcome to my portfolio!
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                I am Sean Louie A. Lopez, a 21-year-old student in third year (junior year) studying Information Technology in Southville International School and Colleges.
                As of the time of this portfolio, I am a four-time Dean's Lister in SISC (starting the first semester of AY 2022-2023 up to the previous semester, second semester of AY 2023-2024).
            </p>
            <h2>
                About me?
            </h2>
            <p class="description">
                I am a left-handed person who is aspiring to be the first member in the family to finish college under IT. My family has mostly been in the aviation industry for a long time.
                Why I wanted to pursue IT is because I have been interested in computers since my childhood. Like the typical family, we did have a computer at home at the time which was running
                Windows XP, then it was upgraded to Windows 7 but it became too slow to the point that we got it replaced with another PC then decided to get laptops instead as it makes our lives
                easier. I have a height of 5'7.5" (172cm, and yes, I am tall for Asian standards but short in Western standards) and I do have an older brother (who finished college but under a 
                different course and different college).
            </p>
            <h2>
                What laptop do you use?
            </h2>
            <p class="description">
                As of the moment, I use a Dell Inspiron laptop with an i7 (11th generation) with 16 gigabytes of random access memory, and 512GB of storage (the same computer I am doing this portfolio on!). If I am not using the laptop,
                I do use an iPad Air (M2, 256GB WiFi-only model) as a secondary device when my tasks do not involve coding.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Behavior in real life?
            </h2>
            <p class="description">
                I am more or less talkative, but I used to be really quiet to the point and had behavioral issues so I had to get OT (occupational therapy) at the Perpetual Help Medical Center
                just to correct these issues in a span of two years (from ages 7 to 9).
            </p>
            <h2>
                How is your experience in Southville?
            </h2>
            <p class="description">
                It has been a very wild ride for me. I came here at just 18 (two months shy of 19) and I was, admittedly, very nervous about moving here as I came from a different school for 
                Preschool to Senior High School, even going as far as representing that school in some competitions that you can read in <a href="achievements.html">Achievements</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>
                What have you been called as by your professors?
            </h2>
            <p class="description">
                I do get called as multiple names over my three years in Southville. When I first came to Southville, my first professor in class was Ms. Caneo, who actually called me Mr. Lopez. Doc Aris, who always sees me in school, 
                calls me as Sean (although he did call me as Louie during the last general assembly). In terms of most professors, they would just call me Sean although some professors have used various ways of calling
                me. Ms. Karla has called me Louie since the start of my time here as it's what I prefer while for Sir Jake, he always has troubles pronouncing everyone's names to the point that it gets butchered so he
                did call me as Louie or Mr. Lopez to make it easier (yes, I did see him in the 2023-2024 season and he was the same professor who was surprised to see me being tall).
                <br><br>
                Sir Julian has done the same as most professors but he did call me as Louie a few times, to the chagrin of myself, all because of one of my classmates calling on me as an example and that my reaction was that my eyes
                went into a state of intensified stare. Sir Ducut has done the same (to also the chagrin of myself) but for Sir Gilbert, he did the same as the other professors before calling me with my full first name (like Ms. Thea
                and Sir Logan has always done). Sir Dean, on the other hand, follows the naming convention of Sir Jake due to me being his classmate (surprise!) so it was expected.
                <br>TL;DR - You can just call me either Sean, Sean Louie, Louie, or even Mr. Lopez, and I will allow it.
