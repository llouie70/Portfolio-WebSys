        <h2>What are your other hobbies outside of coding?</h2>
        <p class="description">When I am not doing things for school, I do doomscroll (admittedly a lot) on Reddit, more specifically <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/eurovision">r/Eurovision</a> and <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/college">r/College</a>.</p>
        <h2>Do you use social media?</h2>
        <p class="description">I do use social media, but I will not be disclosing it here. However, I will gladly put a link to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/llouie70/">my personal Reddit profile</a>. As you can see here, as of the writing of this page, I have â‰¤6,000 karma as I may have been doomscrolling too much
        and also helping out in the Reddit community. I started using Reddit in 2016 so this explains why I have thousands of karma (soon turning 10 years on Reddit next year).</p>
