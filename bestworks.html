            On this page, you will see my best works in SISC throughout my three-year stay. Fair warning that I will just be linking the GitHub links here due to some of these projects being very long.
            I will be putting descriptions on why do I consider it as part of my best works.

            This is my latest work that I did individually as a student. This actually only took me a day (actually, half a day!) to code due to the fact that it took me a while to decide what site do I
            want to propose for the preliminary term. The rest of my class did their preliminary project in two to three weeks, while I was sick for most of the time. I was suffering a sore throat which
            made my voice sound quite husky for a while and it was unfortunately needed for the presentation. I was only able to properly recover the day before the presentation (October 9th to be exact)
            so I got to work immediately. The twist here is that our website's two color palettes are determined by Pok√©mon, and that I got Swellow which meant that I had to use its colors (both regular
            and shiny, which was a total of seven colors which were a dark shade of blue, red, green, gold, white, dark gray, and yellow). 
            <br><br>
            This website is meant for people who cannot decide (like me!) and that this was one of two proposals I considered, the other one being the address book (of which ended up not being used
            as this one got approved). This was coded from the evening of 7th of October (login page only) up to the midnight of 10th of October (rest of the website). Despite the one-day coding marathon
            I did, I ended up scoring a respectable 97.75% (391 points out of 400) due to it being simple and that it does what it needs to do, no more and no less. This website is a showcase of JavaScript
            (JS) as a function of a website in terms of calculations and picking choices, hence the design and images not being the main focus but rather the content and the usability function of the website.
            My voice had only recovered from a sore throat on the day of the presentation, so there is that and that I was the first presenter in the class of DSBA and AIML.
