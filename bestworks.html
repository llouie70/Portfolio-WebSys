            On this page, you will see my best works in SISC throughout my three-year stay. Fair warning that I will just be linking the GitHub links here due to some of these projects being very long.
            I will be putting descriptions on why do I consider it as part of my best works.

            This is my latest work that I did individually as a student. The twist here is that our website's two color palettes are determined by Pok√©mon, and that I got Swellow which meant that I had to use its colors (both regular
            and shiny, which was a total of seven colors which were a dark shade of blue, red, green, gold, white, dark gray, and yellow). This website is meant for people who cannot decide. It has a dice, an FAQ, and a choice picker
            which functions similarly to the Magic 8-Ball but has more freedom on what choices to pick from.
